        <p>Somehow you've stumbled upon this site–welcome! My name is Shiwei, and I'm attending High School in Cupertino, California.
          I play the piano and am a cellist at the San Jose Youth Symphony, too. Sometimes, I watch anime, and sometimes I
          listen to Japanese music. In the past, I've daydreamed about composing, mixing, and sharing an anime opening-like
           song of my own online. I've also daydreamed quite a bit about starting my own band and playing covers of Japanese songs
            and original works inspired by what I've listened to. </p>

            <br>

        <p>I've realized, however, that both of these goals require me to first learn about what it is that makes Japanese music special at all.
          And that's what this site is for–for me to have some motivation to learn neat theory concepts while
          simultaneously creating a platform to share this awesome stuff with you guys. Follow along with me as I try to demystify
          the mysteries of Jpop and J-music–We'll be covering everything from common chord progressions and tritone
           substitution to dominant-7th modulations and key fluctuations. We'll also be tackling less theoretically mind-numbing
           activities like analyzing popular Japanese music, and just talking about music in general. Hope to see you around! </p>
