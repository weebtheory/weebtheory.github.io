          <h2>Why focus on Japanese music in particular?</h2>
            <p>My interest in Japanese music probably began because I grew up listening to Japanese music from anime and games.
            I decided to talk about Japanese music instead of more widely studied genres like Classical of Jazz because I felt it interested me the most.
            Both Classical and Jazz music have been well documented by this point, and I feel as if it would be redundant if I were to cover them here.</p>
            <br>

          <h2>I am new to music theory, or don't know where to begin on this subject--where do I go?</h2>
            <p>I have compiled a <a href="resources.html">list of resources</a> for both those looking to get into theory and those looking to
            learn more about Japanese music. I would also recommend joining some dedicated music theory communities; links may be found in the resources page as well.
            If you're really looking to level up your theory skills, then I would recommend hitting up universities in your area, and having a talk with some of the professors there.
             Best of luck and have fun!</p>

          <h2>Theres a blog with a similar name and type of content to yours. What gives?</h2>
            <p>When I was initially in the process of creating this blog, I didn't know that there was also a similarly titled site called 'Weeb Theory' too.
            After I found out, I decided to borrow some aesthetic elements from that site which I found pleasing. Credits to (Angular?) and his
            <a href="https://weebtheory.wordpress.com/">similarly themed website</a> for giving me some of the ideas I eventually used to develop mine.
          </p>

            <br>

            <h2>How often will this blog be updated?</h2>
              <p>I will try my best to write a new article every month, though I can't promise you that they will all arrive on time! Some real-life issues
              might get in the way of me posting too--when I'm less weighed down by those, I will post articles more often.</p>
              <br>

          <h2>Do you do theory lessons?</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, I don't feel as if I am competent enough to teach anyone yet. You're better off finding a local composer or theory teacher to help you continue refining
            your knowledge and skills--good luck!</p>
